                Hi, my name is Clover. I am horse. I female. Napoleon sucks. I am here to change that. Life sucked with Mr. Jones. Every animal hated it.  Do not vote for Mr. Jones. For me, I do not care if you are strong or not strong, if you are smart or not smart. In my eyes, you are all equal. I am the best choice for the new leader. I care about all of you. Every single one of you. Other animals become bad with lots of power. Napoleon, for example. He sold the hen‚Äôs eggs. He made trades with humans. But, with me, I am kind, I am commmmmpasssssssssionnnnattteee. üòä

                I am not the smartest. Pigs, like Snowball, are smart. But did they rule well? No they did not. At the end of the book, Napoleon was seen ‚Äì wearing human clothes, doing human activities. ‚ÄúAfter that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters‚Äù (Orwell 133). Not a good thing. We decided anything related to two legs was bad. They took advantage of them being smart to do what they wanted ‚Äì not for the good of the people. Smart ruler is bad ruler. Smart animals bad. Because they take advantage. I would not. With the farm, everyone can do anything they want. And everyone gets food. Everyone gets shelter. Do you all want food? So much food that you never feel hungry. Then vote for me. This will be a free place, where no one does not get food... At the end of the year, we should have no fighting, no killing, and be together with other farms. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre weak or strong, Clover will help you get along.

            <h2>Why you should vote for me:</h2>
            <p><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If I lead, the farm succeeds.</li>
                <li>I am the genuine heart of the farm. Only the wise can recognize a leader born from the soil, not from deception.</li>
                <li>I will lead the transition to a future of everlasting harvests.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <br>
                My life has been a tapestry woven with the joys of motherhood and the heavy cloak of witness to our collective struggles. With each foal I've brought into this world, my commitment to our home has grown stronger.

                I've seen the rise and fall of promises, the ebb and flow of hope. "I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children," as I've reflected in quieter moments, speaks to the depth of my dedication (Orwell 31). My figure bears the marks of life given and care provided, and I carry these proudly as a testament to my devotion to our farm's future.

                In the shadow of our barn, I've watched leaders rise and falter, their words once full of honeyed promises, leaving behind a bitter taste of disillusionment. The vivid image of a pig upon two legs wearing clothes remains etched in my memory, a haunting symbol of a dream deferred and a vision corrupted (Orwell 133).

                Yet here I stand before you, not as a claimant to cleverness or cunning, but as a bastion of the values we once held dear. As the embodiment of our initial dream, I extend an offer to lead not with the iron hoof but with a compassionate heart, steadfast and true.

                Let's sow seeds for a harvest rich with equity and fairness, where no mouth goes unfed, and no back goes unsheltered. It's time to cultivate a future where we all reap the bounty of our shared labors. <br><br>

                With love and solidarity, <br>
                Clover
